<h1 class="content-title">About Me</h1>
<div class="col-3-12"><img src="images/jehan.jpg"/></div><div class="col-9-12"><p>I like to make things that do cool stuff. I started out in construction, studied industrial design, and then realized what I was born to do: build user interfaces and experiences.</p><p> 
I love HTML/CSS, sketching and UX planning, and the Adobe CS suite. I use JS to implement my designs, on the frontend and in node. </p></div><div class="grid"><div class="col-9-12"><p>If I won the lottery tomorrow, I would still work just as hard building things. I like to work on products and projects that change peopleâ€™s routines in the real world, allow them to see the world in a different way, and expand their horizons intellectually and socially.</p><p> 
I am based in San Francisco, California. If you want to get in touch, send me an email at jehan.tremback@gmail.com</p></div></div>
