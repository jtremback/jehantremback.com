<h1>We Beat The Moutain Laptop Case</h1><div class="row"><div class="slot-0-1-2"><p>This is a laptop case I designed for We Beat The Mountain, an innovative company making computer and office accessories out of 100% recycled materials.</p><p>The design of this case was an iterative process, starting with a broad range of design and fabrication concepts, testing in a user group, more refined concepts, and finally culminating in a 3d solid model that was used to make molds for a prototype of the product.</p><p>I collaborated with the WBTM marketing team in Utrecht, Holland over Skype and email to develop the design. They ended up going with a design consultancy in Holland for the final production model, but since I was a second-year student at the time, this doesn't really bother me. The experience of working with a team and real user feedback was a catalyst for me to continue developing my real-world skills.</p></div><div class="slot-3-4-5"><img src="images/wbtm_sketches.png"/></div></div><hr/><div class="row"><div class="slot-6"><img src="images/wbtm_model.png"/></div><div class="slot-7"><p>This is the solid model I developed. From this model, molds were cut, and a prototype was made.</p></div><div class="slot-8"><img src="images/wbtm_render.png"/></div><div class="slot-9"><p>Here is a rendering of the model. Unfortunately, I lost the photos of the prototype (it's been a couple of years), but once I can get WBTM to send them back over, I will post them up.</p></div></div>
