<div class="zoom"><img src="images/hyprender_png8.png"/></div><div class="col-1-2"><p>Hypothesis is a non profit organization building a distributed, open source platform for the collaborative evaluation of information. Right now, this consists of a tool to annotate websites, books, and academic papers.</p><p>These annotations are visible to anyone else who has the extension installed. A reputation system lets users vote on and flag annotations, bringing the best to the top. This will allow people to collaborate on and extend any information online, calling out inaccuracies at their source, and improving the internet for everyone. 
</p></div><div class="col-1-2"><p>I designed the entire interface from scratch, iterating through hundreds of mockups and sketches and writing all of the html/css and some of the Javascript. I focused on making what could be have been a complex and unwieldy interface into something minimal, simple, and easy. I also handled the organizationâ€™s web presence, designing the main informational site and blog, as well as several websites for conferences and events organized by Hypothesis.
