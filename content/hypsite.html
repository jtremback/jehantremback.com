<h1>Hypothesis Site</h1><div class="row"><div class="slot-0-1-2"><p>This is Hypothesisâ€™s main site. It serves as a first stop for anybody looking for information about Hypothesis. It is a Wordpress site, built from scratch. It has several custom loops for displaying blog posts, team members, and numbered lists with images. I designed it to be very clean and minimal, with very close attention payed to layout and typography.</p></div><div class="slot-3-4-5"><img src="images/hypimagine.png"/></div></div>
