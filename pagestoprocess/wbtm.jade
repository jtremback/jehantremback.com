            | This is a laptop case I designed for We Beat The Mountain, an innovative company making computer and office accessories out of 100% recycled materials.
          p
            | The design of this case was an iterative process, starting with a broad range of design and fabrication concepts, testing in a user group, more refined concepts, and finally culminating in a 3d solid model that was used to make molds for a prototype of the product.
          p
            | I collaborated with the WBTM marketing team in Utrecht, Holland over Skype and email to develop the design. They ended up going with a design consultancy in Holland for the final production model, but since I was a second-year student at the time, this doesn't really bother me. The experience of working with a team and real user feedback was a catalyst for me to continue developing my real-world skills.

            | This is the solid model I developed. From this model, molds were cut, and a prototype was made.

            | Here is a rendering of the model. Unfortunately, I lost the photos of the prototype (it's been a couple of years), but once I can get WBTM to send them back over, I will post them up.
