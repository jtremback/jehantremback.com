            | Evan, author of the popular teleomorph.com blog, wanted to put his good taste to work with a line of screen-printed apparel. We made this bold, imaginative e-commerce shop to go with his style, and appeal to his demographic. It includes intuitive tag-based sorting of items, in-dash sales tracking, and an automatic frontpage display of his featured products.
