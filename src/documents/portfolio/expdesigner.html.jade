    BioFab is a project of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, aiming to be the “world’s first biological design-build facility”.

    BioFab has put together a huge database of DNA snippets. These snippets can be combined in various ways with genes, controlling what quantity of the gene is produced, and the gene’s reliability across organisms. BioFab’s research allows scientists to fine-tune exactly how an inserted gene will behave, and where it will work.
