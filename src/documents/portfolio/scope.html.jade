		The entire interface is coded in haml and sass, allowing it to be deployed in a Rails app. The plan from there was to offer it to conferences as a service. We enter their schedule into the database, their attendees use the app, we get paid.

		Fun fact: this design uses no images, for fast loading. All visual effects are accomplished with css3.
