			%p This is my industrial design portfolio. I studied industrial design (at the Academy of Art University) because I was interested in how we interact with the tools and objects all around us. As I studied, I began to realize that all the really interesting stuff, like complex interactions and behavior, occurs on the screens of our devices.

			%p The portfolio site itself was built to be as simple as possible (much like the site you are on right now). I wanted to keep it casual and keep the userâ€™s attention on my work, instead of the site. At the same time, I wanted it to have a theme and be somewhat memorable.
