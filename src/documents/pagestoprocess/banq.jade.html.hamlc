			%p Banq Design is a web design consultancy that I started with Jenny Ryan summer 2011. Our aim is to produce engaging, highly interactive websites for our clients. 
			%p Our clients have included an international internet policy blogger, an online clothing label, a personal security firm, and more. Banq has been a great experience for me in the realms of small business administration, marketing, and sales. 
			%p Itâ€™s also been great to hone my WordPress skills, giving me the ability to quickly build full-featured websites that can be administered easily by the end user.
