    I designed the entire interface from scratch, iterating through hundreds of mockups and sketches and writing all of the html/css and some of the Javascript. I focused on making what could be have been a complex and unwieldy interface into something minimal, simple, and easy. I also handled the organization’s web presence, designing the main informational site and blog, as well as several websites for conferences and events organized by Hypothesis.
