      | I like to make things that do cool stuff. I started out in construction, studied industrial design, and then realized what I was born to do: build user interfaces and experiences.

      | I love HTML/CSS, sketching and UX planning, and the Adobe CS suite. I use JS to implement my designs, on the frontend and in node.

      | If I won the lottery tomorrow, I would still work just as hard building things. I like to work on products and projects that change peopleâ€™s routines in the real world, allow them to see the world in a different way, and expand their horizons intellectually and socially.
