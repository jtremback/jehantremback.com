      | BioFab is a project of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, aiming to be the “world’s first biological design-build facility”.
    p From their website:
    p
      | “BioFab projects will be designed to produce broadly useful collections of standard biological parts that can be made freely available to both academic and commercial users...”

      | Working in close collaboration with their software lead, Marc Juul, I designed the Expression Designer to allow researchers to to quickly sift through the large volumes of data that BioFab has produced. BioFab has put together a huge database of DNA snippets. These snippets can be combined in various ways with genes, controlling how much of the gene is produced, and the gene’s reliability across organisms. BioFab’s research allows scientists to fine-tune exactly how an inserted gene will behave, and where it will work.

    h3 The problem:
    p
      | With so many snippets, and so much data about each snippet, how can a researcher ever hope to find the right combination of genetic material to make their experiment a success?
    h3 Our solution:
    p Constraint-based graphical search of the BioFab database.

      | The user selects a range of performance with the main slider. The histogram on top shows the user within what range the most results will be found.

    p
      | The user adds constraints, filtering by sequences they wish to include and exclude. In this iteration, we have included only simple constraints. In future versions we may start to phase in full Boolean logic and other more advanced criteria.

    p
      | The user receives a list of Expression Operating Units (EOU’s) represented by expandable widgets. Each EOU widget contains a gauge displaying its performance and the performance of its constituent parts. It also contains a 1-10 rating of its reliability, represented on a dot gauge.

    p
      | The EOU widget also contains diagram widgets representing the parts that make it up. The diagrams show the most important identifying sequences of each part, along with individual measures of performance and reliability. The diagram widgets can be dragged into the constraint area for a fluid search experience.
