      | This is Hypothesisâ€™s main site. It serves as a first stop for anybody looking for information about Hypothesis. It is a Wordpress site, built from scratch. It has several custom loops for displaying blog posts, team members, and numbered lists with images. I designed it to be very clean and minimal, with very close attention payed to layout and typography.
