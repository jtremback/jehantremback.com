    BioFab is a project of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, aiming to be the “world’s first biological design-build facility”.
  p.
    BioFab has put together a huge database of DNA snippets. These snippets can be combined in various ways with genes, controlling what quantity of the gene is produced, and the gene’s reliability across organisms. BioFab’s research allows scientists to fine-tune exactly how an inserted gene will behave, and where it will work.

    Working in close collaboration with their software lead, Marc Juul, I designed the Expression Designer to allow researchers to to quickly sift through the large volumes of data that BioFab has produced.

The diagrams show the most important identifying sequences of each part, along with individual measures of performance and reliability. The diagram widgets can be dragged into the constraint area for a fluid search experience.
